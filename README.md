# Face Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to detect facial emotions in images or real-time video streams. It classifies human emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, and Neutral.

## Features

- Real-time webcam-based facial emotion detection
- Trained CNN model using FER-2013 dataset
- Uses Haar Cascade for face detection
- Displays emotion labels on detected faces
- Modular Python code for training and inference

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
